**"This is a Power Distribution Module desktop application built with Rust and React. It provides real-time monitoring of 8 electrical channels, showing voltage, current, and power consumption. You can see individual channel controls here, an emergency kill switch for safety, test mode functionality, and a professional automotive-style interface. The project uses a Rust backend for hardware communication and a React frontend for the interactive dashboard. Each file serves a specific purpose - the Rust main.rs handles hardware, App.tsx creates the dashboard interface, and Electron wraps it as a desktop application."**
